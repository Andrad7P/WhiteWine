This project explores data related to white wines, focusing on key aspects such as price, customer ratings, and
regional differences in wine production. Through visualizations like price trends over time, scatter plots of price vs. rating, 
and country-based comparisons, the project aims to provide
insights into how these factors relate to wine quality.
By analyzing the data, consumers can make more informed wine purchase decisions,
and businesses can better understand market trends.
